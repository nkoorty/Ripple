Ripsplit is an iOS dApp built on the XRP EVM sidechain. It simplifies the process of splitting expenses and settling payments by using account abstraction and uses smart contracts to facilitate group management in a trustless and decentralised manner.

### Problem Statement

RipSplit is a mobile app designed to change how groups manage and settle expenses. As the expense splitting market is expected to grow to half a [billion dollars by 2031](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/bill-splitting-apps-market-100395#:~:text=The%20global%20bill%20splitting%20apps,of%20splitting%20the%20expenses%20easy.), existing solutions fall short, lacking efficient, decentralised payment methods. This often results in complex and error-prone processes, especially in activities like travel, dining, or shared living, where managing expenses can require tedious manual tracking and constant follow-ups for repayments. Similar apps suffer with real time tracking, challenges in dealing with multiple currencies, and reliance on one individual to manage all records, leading to potential delays and disputes. Moreover, traditional apps tend to rely on centralised payment systems like banks or PayPal, which can limit flexibility and transparency.

RipSplit addresses these issues by facilitating direct, in-app settlements using the XRP EVM sidechain, significantly simplifying the management of shared expenses while enhancing security and flexibility. This approach ensures a smoother, more reliable and versatile experience in handling group finances, directly within the app.
